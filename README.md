Conway's Game of Life as a Service

A small client-server app in Clojure & ClojureScript that runs
conway's game of life simulation.

The server exposes a single API endpoint, `/evolve`, that accepts POST
requests that takes an
[EDN-formatted](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) world
representation like:

    {:width  3
     :height 3
     :age    0
     :board [[true  false false]
             [false true  false]
             [false false true]]}

And responds with an evolved board state:

    {:width  3
     :height 3
     :age    1
     :board [[false false false]
             [false true  false]
             [false false false]]}

The server parallelizes processing of this value, so it should provide
an advantage over client-side processing for large datasets. The
server performs some sanity-checking of the posted data and will
return a 400 if it cannot be validated. If data is posted
without a `:board`, however, a randomized board state will be
generated.

## Prerequisites
